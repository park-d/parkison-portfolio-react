This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is my professional portfolio. Is it a single page React application. It contains four sections: about, projects, contact, and resume. In the about section you can view a short blurb about me, projects display 6 of my recent web development projects, contact is a form that you can fill out in order to get in touch with me, and finally resume contains my downloadable resume, as well as lists of hard and soft skills.
